#reCAPTCHA MAILHIDE API


This PHP class will help you create encrypted email addresses and URLs for Google reCAPTCHA Mailhide API (https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/old/docs/mailhideapi)

Note: Google has recently (i.e. 1/10/2015) removed the old mailhideapi documentation, and the link for the new documentation is still broken. I'm hoping, for obvious reasons, that they will correct this situation soon.
